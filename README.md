# Taxi service search and tests

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

In this task, you will implement search feature for your website and write tests for your project.

1. Implement search feature for all 3 pages with content:
   - drivers - by username
   - cars - by model
   - manufacturers - by name
2. Write tests for custom and for core project features (no need to test built-in functionality).
   Use this [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Testing) as helper.
   You decide what to test and how to test (train your testing skills here).
3. Make your website looks better. Customize your templates, add static images for taxi service.
   Just make it looks better using your imagination :)
4. (Optional): Add some new features for this project. If you want to adjust project or add some
   new functionality - it's the ideal moment for it.

NOTE: Attach screenshots of all created or modified pages to pull request. It's important to attach images not links to them.
