# Taxi service search and tests

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

In this task, you will implement search feature for your website and write tests for your project.

1. Implement search feature for all 3 pages with content:
   - drivers - by username
   - cars - by model
   - manufacturers - by name
2. Write tests for custom and for core project features (no need to test built-in functionality).
   Use this [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Testing) as helper.
   You decide what to test and how to test (train your testing skills here).

NOTE: Attach screenshots of all created pages to pull request. It's important to attach images not links to them.
